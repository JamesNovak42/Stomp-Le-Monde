# Stomp le Monde
## Battlefield 3 tool for Generals

Last modified in February 2013, this project was for use on tablet devices by organized Battlefield 3 match commanders to track unit locations, assist strategic planning, and make giving movement orders easier.

Tap/click the upper left tab to open the units tray. These icons can be dragged to the map, and when a placed unit is clicked, it can be named. To change the name, click again. To delete the unit, simply long-press/long-click on the unit.

Tap/click the lower right tab to open the map selector tray. 64 and 32 player map versions are available, in both the vehicle and infantry-only versions (though this i/v option was intended for a feature that never materialized). All the BF3 maps available for multiplayer are available for selection.

Tapping/clicking on the map will retract any open trays.

The app can be run simply by opening the index.html file in the root folder with a web browser.

The images are not mine, they were simply borrowed. This was a wholly non-commercial project. All rights are reserved for their various copyright holders. If you are one of those holders and wish me to take something down, please contact me.

And yes, the project name is a riff on the Pixies album, "Tromp le Monde". ;)
